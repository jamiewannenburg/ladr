I would like to make python bindings for mace4 using pybind11 and scikit-build-core. It should encompas how it is used in `mace4.src/mace4.c`, but it may be better to make a Mace4 python class in the folder `python_bindings/mace4` and rewrite the functionality of mace4.c, and instead make bindings for `mace4.src/msearch.h`, which would be in `python_bindings/mace4/mace4_bindings.cpp`. It is probably a good idea to first create bindings converting python lists to Plist and back, so that a user can input a list of formulas/clauses themselves.
You can run the bash script `build_and_test.py` from `python_bindings` to test your implementation.
You can find the include graph in `TODO/include_graph.xml` to help descide what should be included in `python_bindings/CMakeLists.txt`. 
For examples you can look at the `python_bindings` directory to find working bindings for `ladr/formula.h`, `ladr/term.h` and `ladr/parse.h`. Wrapper files were sometimes needed for C functions that are reserved in C++.
