<h1>Given Selection (Advanced)</h1>

This page describes a mechanism that allows the user to have
more control over selection of given clauses than the ordinary
parameters
<a href="select.html#age_part"><tt><b>age_part</b></tt></a>,
<a href="select.html#true_part"><tt><b>true_part</b></tt></a>,
<a href="select.html#false_part"><tt><b>false_part</b></tt></a>,
<a href="select.html#weight_part"><tt><b>weight_part</b></tt></a>,
<a href="select.html#hints_part"><tt><b>hints_part</b></tt></a>,
and
<a href="select.html#random_part"><tt><b>random_part</b></tt></a>.
(See the page <a href="select.html">Selecting the Given Clause</a>
for the basic mechanism.)

<p>
The user can input a list "<tt>given_selection</tt>"
rules that specify how given clauses are to be selected.
Each rule has the form
<pre class="my_file">
part( <font color="#D10000"><i>name</i></font>, <font color="#D10000"><i>priority</i></font>, <font color="#D10000"><i>order</i></font> , <font color="#D10000"><i>property</i></font> ) = <font color="#D10000"><i>n</i></font>.
</pre>
<ul>
<li><font color="#D10000"><i>name</i></font> is an identifier
string chosen by the user; it is used when given clauses are
printed to identify the rule that was used to select the given clause.

<li><font color="#D10000"><i>priority</i></font> must be "high" or "low";
All high-priority rules are used before any low-priority rules are used.

<li><font color="#D10000"><i>order</i></font> must be "age"
(increasing clause ID),
"weight" (increasing clause weight),
or "random";  it is used to order the clauses that satisfy
the <font color="#D10000"><i>property</i></font>.

<li><font color="#D10000"><i>property</i></font> is an expression
in the <a href="clause-properties.html"> Clause Properties</a> language.

<li><font color="#D10000"><i>n</i></font> is a positive integer; it
specifies the number of given clauses that are selected according to
the rule before moving to the next rule.

</ul>

For example the default settings
(see <a href="select.html">Selecting the Given Clause</a>)
<pre class="my_file">
assign(hints_part, INT_MAX).
assign(age_part, 1).
assign(true_part, 4).
assign(false_part, 4).
</pre>
are operationally similar to the following list of rules.
<pre class="my_file">
list(given_selection).
  part(H, high, weight,  hint) = 1.
  part(A,  low,    age,   all) = 1.
  part(T,  low, weight,  true) = 4.
  part(F,  low, weight, false) = 4.
end_of_list.
</pre>

<h2>Selection by Ratio</h2>

Ignore high-priority rules for a moment and consider a list of
low-priority rules.  The positive integers (the parts) at the ends
of the rules determine a <i>ratio cycle</i>.  If there are three
rules with parts 3,1,4, the cycle has size 8, with 3 clauses selected
by the first rule, 1 clause by the second rule, 4 by the third rule,
and so on.  The ratio cycle is [3,1,4].  If no clauses of the
required type are available, that part of the cycle is simply skipped.
This much is essentially
the same as the basic method described in
<a href="select.html">Selecting the Given Clause</a>.

<h2>Priority: High and Low</h2>

The given_selection rules are partitioned into "high" and "low"
priority, and each partition determines a ratio cycle.

<p>
When Prover9 needs a new given clause, it first tries to find
one by using the high-priority rules, picking up in the high-priority
cycle where it left off.
Consider the following rules.
<pre class="my_file">
list(given_selection).
  part(Hint_age,  high,    age,        hint) = 2.
  part(Hint_wt,   high, weight,        hint) = 3.

  part(Age,        low,    age,         all) = 1.
  part(Pos,        low, weight,    positive) = 2.
  part(Nonpos,     low, weight,   -positive) = 4.
end_of_list.
</pre>
As long as clauses matching hints are available, they are selected
in a cycle of size 5: 2 by age, then 3 by weight, and so on.
When no more clauses matching hints are available, Prover9 reverts to
the low-priority rules, selecting given clauses in a cycle of size 7.
If any high-priority clauses become available, Prover9 immediately goes
back to the high-priority cycle.

<h2>Covering All Clauses</h2>

We recommend that the list of rules cover all clauses that Prover9 keeps.
(A rule with property "all" is sufficient, but not necessary.)
If a kept clause does not match any of the rules, a warning message
is printed.  In this case, there can be sos clauses that will never
be selectedas.  (It is possible that such clauses can still be used by
subsumption, back demodulation, or back unit deletion.)

<h2>The Ordinary Selection Parameters (<a href="select.html#age_part"><tt><b>age_part</b></tt></a>, etc.)</h2>

The ordinary parameters
<a href="select.html#age_part"><tt><b>age_part</b></tt></a>,
<a href="select.html#true_part"><tt><b>true_part</b></tt></a>,
<a href="select.html#false_part"><tt><b>false_part</b></tt></a>,
<a href="select.html#weight_part"><tt><b>weight_part</b></tt></a>,
<a href="select.html#hints_part"><tt><b>hints_part</b></tt></a>,
and
<a href="select.html#random_part"><tt><b>random_part</b></tt></a>
can be thought of as shorthand for given_selection rules.
In fact, if the user does not input a list of given_selection
rules, Prover9 constructs and uses an internal given_selection
list by using those parameters.

<p>
However, if the user <i>does</i> input given_selection rules,
<i>those five parameters are ignored</i>.  In particular, if the user
inputs given_selection rules, and if hints are being used, there
probably should be (at least) a high_priority rule with
property "hint" so that the hints will be used.

<h3>Input_sos_first</h3>

The flag <a href="select.html#input_sos_first"><tt><b>input_sos_first</b></tt></a> (default set) says that all
initial clauses (sos clauses that exist when the first given clause
is selected) are to be selected as give clauses before any
non-initial clauses.  <i>This flag is implemented with a high-priority
rule</i>.

<p>
Contrary to the hints case, if the user inputs given_selection rules,
and if the flag <a href="select.html#input_sos_first"><tt><b>input_sos_first</b></tt></a>, Prover9 will automatically
insert the following rule as the first high-priority rule.
<pre class="my_file">
  part(I, high, age, initial) = INT_MAX.
</pre>

If the user wishes to override this behavior, for example by
having initial clauses selected immediately by weight instead of age,
the flag <a href="select.html#input_sos_first"><tt><b>input_sos_first</b></tt></a> can be cleared, and the
following can be used as the first high-priority rule.
<pre class="my_file">
  part(I_wt, high, weight, initial) = INT_MAX.
</pre>
