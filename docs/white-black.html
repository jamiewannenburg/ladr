<h1>Keep and Delete Rules (Advanced)</h1>

This page describes a mechanism that allows the user to have
more control over which clauses are kept or deleted than
by using the parameters
<a href="process-inf.html#max_weight"><tt><b>max_weight</b></tt></a>,
<a href="process-inf.html#max_vars"><tt><b>max_vars</b></tt></a>,
<a href="process-inf.html#max_literals"><tt><b>max_literals</b></tt></a>,
and
<tt>max_depth</tt>.

<p>
The mechanism uses the <a href="clause-properties.html">
Clause Properties</a> language for specifying clauses that
are to be kept or deleted.

<p>
Two lists can be given in the input: a "<tt>keep</tt>" list
and a "<tt>delete</tt>" list.  Here are examples of each.
<pre class="my_file">
list(keep).
    -horn & literals=3 & variables=0 & level<4.
    horn & variables<3.
end_of_list.

list(delete).
    weight > 30.
    weight > 20 & (-horn | variables > 4).
end_of_list.
</pre>

<p>
Given a newly derived clause, the following procedure is applied.

<pre class="my_code">
If the clause satisfies any rule in the "keep" list, then
    the clause is kept;
else if the clause satisfies any rule in the "delete" list, then
    the clause is deleted;
else
    the clause is kept;
</pre>
Note that if the clause satisfies rules in both lists, it is kept.

<p>
The ordinary parameters
<a href="process-inf.html#max_weight"><tt><b>max_weight</b></tt></a>,
<a href="process-inf.html#max_vars"><tt><b>max_vars</b></tt></a>,
<a href="process-inf.html#max_literals"><tt><b>max_literals</b></tt></a>,
and
<tt>max_depth</tt>
are can be thought of as shorthand for simple rules in the
"<tt>delete</tt>" list.  For example the pair of commands
<pre class="my_file">
assign(max_literals, 3).
assign(max_vars, 0).
</pre>
are operationally equivalent to the "<tt>delete</tt>" list
<pre class="my_file">
list(delete).
    literals > 3.
    variables > 4.
end_of_list.
</pre>
In fact, the parameters
<a href="process-inf.html#max_weight"><tt><b>max_weight</b></tt></a>,
<a href="process-inf.html#max_vars"><tt><b>max_vars</b></tt></a>,
<a href="process-inf.html#max_literals"><tt><b>max_literals</b></tt></a>,
and
<tt>max_depth</tt>
are implemented in Prover9 by constructing an internal
"<tt>delete</tt>" list, and any "<tt>delete</tt>" list given
by the user is simply appended to the internal list.

<p>
The rules in the "<tt>delete</tt>" list are not applied
to initial clauses; that is, clauses that are input or
derived before the selection of the first given clause.
