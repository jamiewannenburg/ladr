<h1>Production Mode</h1>

Prover9's <i>production mode</i> allows for <i>state-space searches</i>.
That is, it starts with 
<ul>
<li> one or more initial states,
<li> a set of production rules that lead from one state to the next, and
<li> one or more goal states.
</ul>

<p>
The production mode is implemented by using Prover9's hyperreolution
inference rule.  Also, an enhanced form of rewriting (demodulation)
is used, including
<ul>
<li> evaluable functions and relations (implicit rules), such as
integer arithmetic and Boolean operations;
<li> conditional rewrite rules which can apply to atomic formulas as
well as to terms.
</ul>
The rewriting is applied to the (instantiated) antecedents of the
production rules as well as to the consequents.
<p>
The production mode is enabled by setting the following flag.
<!-- start option auto -->
<a name="auto">
<pre class="my_option">
set(production).
clear(production).  % default clear
</pre>

<blockquote>
The only direct effect
of setting  this flag is that it changes several options as follows.
<pre>
  set(production) -> set(raw).
  set(produtcion) -> set(hyper_resolution).
  set(produtcion) -> set(eval_rewrite).
  set(produtcion) -> clear(back_subsume).
</pre>
</blockquote>
<!-- end option -->
<p>
The <tt>raw</tt> option, which cancels many of the default Prover9
settings, is used because the production mode is quite different
and more limited in nature from the ordinary mode of Prover9.

<p>
Here is a simple example which uses evaluable arithmetic operations (but no
explicit rewrite rules).

<pre class="my_job">
prover9 -f <a href="jugs.in">jugs.in</a> &gt; <a href="jugs.out">jugs.out</a>
</pre>

And here are two simple examples that use explicit rewrite rules.

<pre class="my_job">
prover9 -f <a href="cabbages.in">cabbages.in</a> &gt; <a href="cabbages.out">cabbages.out</a>
</pre>

<pre class="my_job">
prover9 -f <a href="queens3.in">queens3.in</a> &gt; <a href="queens3.out">queens3.out</a>
</pre>

Here is a more complex example.

<pre class="my_job">
prover9 -f <a href="2inverter.in">2inverter.in</a> &gt; <a href="2inverter.out">2inverter.out</a>
</pre>

The following job shows examples of several list-processing functions.

<pre class="my_job">
prover9 -f <a href="list.in">list.in</a> &gt; <a href="list.out">list.out</a>
</pre>

<h2>Evaluable Operations</h2>

See the page <a href="syntax.html#built_in">Clauses and Formulas</a>

*The double forms of the conjunction and disjunction operations
(<tt>&&</tt> and <tt>||</tt>) are logically the same as the single
forms (<tt>&</tt> and <tt>|</tt>); the double forms are used to
prevent expansion of production rules.  For example,
if a production rule is written as
<pre class="my_file">
P & (Q1 | Q2) -> R.
</pre>
it will be expanded to the pair of clauses
<pre class="my_file">
P & Q1 -> R.
P & Q2 -> R.
</pre>
by the clausification process.  If Q1 and Q2 are evaluable,
it is usually more efficient use the original form of the rule;
using the double form of the disjunction operator prevents expansion:
<pre class="my_file">
P & (Q1 || Q2) -> R.
</pre>
The double forms never have to be used in rewrite rules.

<h2>Enhanced Rewrite Rules for Production Mode</h2>

Ordinary Prover9 rewrite rules (demodulators) are always equations,
which are used to rewrite terms.  When in production mode, Prover9
can use enhanced rewrite rules, which can be conditional and which can
rewrite atomic formulas as well as terms.

<p>
<i>Equational rules</i> rewrite terms, and <i>equivalence rules</i>
rewrite atomic formulas.  Either kind of rule can have conditions.

<p>
Many of the following examples use terms that are lists.  Recall that
lists are built from a binary constructor function <tt>$cons</tt>
and well-formed lists are terminated with <tt>$nil</tt>.
The term <tt>[a:b]</tt> abbreviates <tt>$cons(a,b)</tt>, and the term
<tt>[a,b,c]</tt> abbreviates <tt>$cons(a,$cons(b,$cons(c,$nil)))</tt>.

<h3>Equational Rules</h3>

Equational rules have one of the following forms.
<pre class="my_file">
<i>alpha</i> = <i>beta</i>.    % unconditional
<i>condition</i> -> <i>alpha</i> = <i>beta</i>.
<i>alpha</i> = <i>beta</i> <- <i>condition</i>.
</pre>
In each case, an instance of <tt><i>alpha</i></tt> is rewritten
to the corresponding instance of <tt><i>beta</i></tt> if the
corresponding instance of the <tt><i>condition</i></tt> 
(if present) rewrites to <tt>$T</tt> (true).

<p>
For example, the following three rewrite rules constitute a
function that takes a term <tt>z</tt> and a list of terms, and returns
the sublist of terms that are lexically greater than <tt>z</tt>.

<pre class="my_file">
gt_list(z,[]) = [].
x @>  z -> gt_list(z,[x:y]) = [x:gt_list(z,y)].
x @<= z -> gt_list(z,[x:y]) = gt_list(z,y).
</pre>

(These rewrite rules can be used to build a quicksort function,
see <a href="list.in">list.in</a>.)

<h3>Equivalence Rules</h3>

Equivalence rules rewrite atomic formulas.  The forms are similar to
equational rules, but they have <tt><-></tt> instead of <tt>=</tt> .

<pre class="my_file">
<i>alpha</i> <-> <i>beta</i>.    % unconditional
<i>condition</i> -> (<i>alpha</i> <-> <i>beta</i>).
(<i>alpha</i> <-> <i>beta</i>) <- <i>condition</i>.
</pre>

<p>
For example, the following three rules constitues a membership
relation for lists.

<pre class="my_file">
member(x,[]) <-> $F.
x  == y  -> (member(x,[y:z]) <-> $T).
x !== y  -> (member(x,[y:z]) <-> member(x,z)).
</pre>

In equivalence rules the <tt><i>alpha</i></tt> expression must be
an atomic formula, but the <tt><i>beta</i></tt> expression can
be a non-atomic formula involving disjunction, conjunction, and negation.
For example, the following pair of rules implements a subset
relation on lists.

<pre class="my_file">
subset([], x) <-> $T.
subset([x:y], z) <-> member(x,z) & subset(y,z).
</pre>

If the <tt><i>beta</i></tt> expression of an equivalence rule
is <tt>$T</tt> or <tt>$F</tt>, the rule can be abbreviated in
the obvious way.  For example, the membership relation shown above
can be abbreviated as follows.

<pre class="my_file">
-member(x,[]).
x  == y  -> member(x,[y:z]).
x !== y  -> (member(x,[y:z]) <-> member(x,z)).
</pre>


<h3>Beware of the Distinction between Function and Relation Symbols (Terms and Atomic Formulas)</h3>

<a name="conditional"></a>
<h3>Conditional Expressions (If-expressions)</h3>

Many rewrite rules can be written more conveniently with conditional
<i>expressions</i> than with conditional <i>rules</i>.  A conditional
expression has the following form.
<pre class="my_file">
if(<i>condition</i>, <i>then_part</i>, <i>else_part</i>)
</pre>
When evaluating a conditional expression,
<ul>
<li> if the <i>condition</i> evaluates to <tt>$T</tt>, the value of the
expression is <i>then_part</i>;
<li> if the <i>condition</i> evaluates to <tt>$F</tt>, the value of the
expression is <i>else_part</i>;
<li> if the <i>condition</i> evaluates to neither <tt>$T</tt> nor <tt>$F</tt>,
the "<tt>if</tt>" expression is not evaluated (but the <i>then_part</i> and
the <i>else_part</i> are evaluated);  in this case, the result will contain
an if-expression, indicating that something is probably wrong with it.
</ul>

The <i>condition</i> of an if-expression must be an evaluable
formula (Boolean-valued object).
If the if-expression occurs in the context of a term,
the <i>then_part</i> and the <i>else_part</i> must also be terms.
If the if-expression occurs in the context of a formula,
the <i>then_part</i> and the <i>else_part</i> must also be formulas.

<p>
Here are two examples of rules containing if-expressions.
The membership relation has the if-expression in the context
of a formula, and the intersection function has it in the
context of a term.

<pre class="my_file">
-member(x,[]).
member(x,[y:z]) <-> if(x == y, $T, member(x,z)).

intersect([], x) = [].
intersect([x:y],z) = if(member(x,z),[x:intersect(y,z)],intersect(y,z)).
</pre>

<h2>Hyperresolution in Production Mode</h2>

The hyperresolution inference rule is used when Prover9 is in production mode.
Recall that in hyperresolution all of the negative literals of the nucleus
(antecedents of the production rule) must be operated on so that the
result is a positive clause.  In production mode, the negative literals
(antecedents) are partitioned into <i>resolvable</i> literals
and <i>evaluable</i> literals.  Consider the production rule
in one of the examples given above.

<pre class="my_file">
J(x, y) & (x+y <= 4) -> J(0, y+x).           % empty the small jug into the big jug
</pre>

The first antecedent is resolvable, because it is headed by the state predicate
<tt>J</tt>, and the second is evalable, because it is headed by a built-in
evaluable operation.

<p>
An antecedent can also be evaluable if it is headed by a <i>defined</i>
evaluable operation; that is, there is an equivalence rewrite rule to
evaluate it.  Consider the production rule from 8-Queens example
above (assume set(prolog_style_variables)).
<pre class="my_file">
board(B) & pick(New_col) & ok(B, 1, New_col) -> board([New_col:B]).
</pre>
The first two antecedents are resolvable:
the first takes a state, and the second picks a column to try to fill in.
The third antecedent is evaluable, because there are equivalence
rule to evaluate it (in this case, it checks whether a state transition
can take place).

<pre class="my_file">
formulas(demodulators).

ok([], X, Y) <-> $T.

ok([H:T], Rows_back, New_col) <->
	-(H == New_col) &
	-(H + -Rows_back == New_col) &
	-(H + Rows_back == New_col) &
	ok(T, Rows_back+1, New_col).

end_of_list.
</pre>

<h2>Justifications in Production Mode</h2>

When Prover9 is in production mode, clause justifications for
hyperresolution are similar to those in ordinary mode, but
justifications for rewriting (demodulation) is different,
and there is a new kind of justfication for evaluation.
<p>
In ordinary mode, Prover9 shows the <i>sequence</i> of rewrite
steps, with data on where the rewrite occurred and the direction
of the rewrite.  In production mode, Prover9 simply shows
the <i>set</i> of rules that were applied.  This difference is because
in production mode, there can be extremely long sequences of
rewrites.
<p>
When evaluation of a built-in evaluable operation occurs,
Prover9 simply reports the number of evaluation steps.
Consider a clause from the 8-Queens example above:

<pre class="my_file">
board([6,3,1,4,8]).  [hyper(2,a,226,a,b,8,a),rewrite([13,12]),eval(40)].
</pre>
The justification shows the two resolution steps, rewriting
with two rules, and 40 evaluations with built-in operations.
